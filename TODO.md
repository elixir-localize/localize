# TODO

Outstanding work on Localize. The design detail behind these items lives under [plans/](plans/); the shipped history is in [CHANGELOG.md](CHANGELOG.md), and the release standing is in [STATUS.md](STATUS.md).

## Open

* [ ] **Decide whether root's `arab` and `arabext` blocks become a pipeline source** — plan item 38: CLDR JSON does not carry them, so `en-u-nu-arab` formats with the locale's `latn` symbols until `common/main/root.xml` is read directly.

* [ ] **Settle the location format of a non-location zone with CLDR** — TR35 49 says a zone with no region (`PST8PDT`, `Etc/GMT+5`) falls back to the offset format, then gives "PST8PDT, generic → Unknown Location Time" as its worked example. Localize follows the first; the conformance data has no case. Worth a CLDR ticket.

* [ ] **Audit `cldr-49`-only code for map-order dependence** — the 2026-09-26 audit covered `main`. [plans/map-order.md](plans/map-order.md).

### Upstream parity for the MF2 `i:` functions

* [ ] **Print and speak output for the `i:` functions** — upstream can emit a result's speak line (`:i:numeral withStyle=asSpokenWords` speaks "four", `:i:quantify` speaks "un niño"); our MF2 output carries only the print form. The oracle is unicode-org/inflection's `test/resources/inflection/message2/*.xml`; see [plans/mf2-namespace-inflection.md](plans/mf2-namespace-inflection.md).

## In progress

* [ ] **CLDR 49 upgrade** — the plan's items are closed bar those listed here; what remains is the beta2 refresh below. Work lives on the `cldr-49` branch, which does not merge to `main` until the final beta. [plans/cldr-49.md](plans/cldr-49.md).

## Blocked

* [ ] **Refresh to CLDR 49 beta2 and re-run the conformance suites** — blocked on the CLDR 49 beta2 release, expected 2026-10. It brings the `scope="core"` display-name fix (CLDR-19774, which missed beta1), `datetime.json` in the Clock12/Clock24 labels, and CLDR-19066's skeleton test data, vendored from CLDR `main` ahead of it.

* [ ] **Interval patterns inherited from a different locale level than the single date** — plan item 35: whether to glue or keep the inherited pattern. Blocked on CLDR-14207.

## Deferred

* [ ] **Recheck map-order selections that only today's data keeps deterministic** — seven lookups walk a map and never see two candidates in the current CLDR data; recheck them whenever it is regenerated. [plans/map-order.md](plans/map-order.md).

* [ ] **`localize_emoji` sibling library** — plan item 11, a separate package on its own schedule. A Phoenix LiveView picker (`localize_emoji_live`) is out of scope for its 0.1.0.

## Done

* [x] **Semantic concepts as `i:` operands** — `Localize.Inflection.Concept` takes `:display_data`, forms of its own for sets of constraints as upstream's semantic concepts have, so all 49 upstream MF2 fixtures pass on their print lines. 2026-09-29, v1.4.0.

* [x] **`to=` on `:i:inflect` and `:i:pronoun`** — gives the operand's value for a feature (`to=number` gives `plural`), printing the operand for an unknown feature, as upstream does. 2026-09-29, v1.4.0.

* [x] **`:i:inflect` and `:i:pronoun` as selectors** — `.match` keys match what the function formats, and an unknown `to` feature matches only the catch-all; `:i:quantify`, `:i:list` and `:i:numeral` are not selectors. 2026-09-29, v1.4.0.

* [x] **`withReferent` on `:i:pronoun`** — chooses the pronoun that agrees with a referent string or concept ("mío" with "casas" gives "mías"). 2026-09-29, v1.4.0.

* [x] **Concept and pronoun-concept operands for the `i:` functions** — `:i:inflect` and `:i:quantify` take a `Localize.Inflection.Concept`, `:i:pronoun` a `PronounConcept` with its own pronouns, and either agrees as an option value. 2026-09-29, v1.4.0.

* [x] **Upstream option names, `:i:list` and `:i:numeral`** — the `i:` functions take the Unicode inflection project's option names (`case=`, `withValue=`), reject unknown features, and gain `:i:list` and `:i:numeral`. 2026-09-29, v1.4.0.

* [x] **Move the MF2 inflection functions to the `i` namespace** — `:i:inflect`, `:i:pronoun` and `:i:quantify` replace the `l:` names, and `i` is reserved in place of `l`. 2026-09-29, v1.4.0.

* [x] **Reject an impossible month in the datetime parser's map form** — the map forms of the date, datetime, time and interval parsers reject any field no date or time has, as the struct forms do, instead of dropping or keeping it. 2026-09-29, v1.4.0.

* [x] **Selections that followed map order** — a territory's primary currency, shared narrow currency symbols, the parser's longest and fuzzy matches, territory-name lookup and a locale's number-system order no longer depend on map order. [plans/map-order.md](plans/map-order.md). 2026-09-26, v1.4.0.

* [x] **The pipeline reads the CLDR sources in place** — nothing is copied into `priv/cldr` any more, the cldr-json release and CLDR ref are recorded in `priv/localize`, and `mix localize.fetch_sources` fetches them, so checking out `main` needs no ceremony. Details in [plans/cldr-source-payload.md](plans/cldr-source-payload.md). 2026-09-25.

* [x] **Pattern fields at a width TR35 does not list format as U+FFFD** — `dddd`, `MMMMMM`, `HHH` and the rest follow TR35's Handling Invalid Patterns instead of ICU's padding and clamping; an undefined letter stays an error. 2026-09-25, v1.4.0.

* [x] **Locale downloads retry transient CDN failures** — server errors, timeouts and dropped connections are retried with backoff and jitter, a 404 fails at once, and the address family is configurable. Details in [plans/locale-downloader-resilience.md](plans/locale-downloader-resilience.md). 2026-09-24, v1.4.0.

* [x] **Atom creation audited across the library and tests** — no test mints an atom from a fixture file; `Localize.Utils.Json` lost its atom-key option; `Localize.Inflection` rejects a path-shaped locale. The remaining runtime conversions in `lib/` are bounded and say why. 2026-09-24.

* [x] **CLDR's spec changes since beta1 reviewed** — hour cycle variations, the Date-Timezone and Time-Day-Of-Week glue, `placeholderBoundarySpacing`, plural rules in semantic order and `ha` ≡ `h` implemented; range separator patterns confirmed example-only; pattern-only skeleton symbols are only deprecated for CLDR 50. 2026-09-24.

* [x] **CLDR's full skeleton conformance data** — three further CLDR files wired in, and the matching defects they exposed fixed: weekday and year symbols, text widths, `j`/`C` day periods, lone fields, quoted literals, and skeletons matching `availableFormats` alone. 2026-09-24.

* [x] **Supplemental data regenerated from the beta1 sources** — the committed ETFs predated them: the US POSIX zones, the Eurozone, Breton collation and `u` validity changed. 2026-09-24.

* [x] **Refresh to CLDR 49 beta1** — sources from the cldr-json release zip, a guard against mixing pre-releases in `copy_sources`, and a recorded baseline for curated fixtures. 2026-09-24.

* [x] **Report the cldr-json `scope="core"` defect** — fixed upstream as CLDR-19774, which missed beta1; it arrives with beta2. 2026-09-24.

* [x] **Numeric date and time separators** — `Localize.DateTime.numeric_separators/2`, plus `:numeric_date_separator` and `:numeric_time_separator` on `Localize.Date`, `Localize.Time`, `Localize.DateTime` and `Localize.Interval`. 2026-09-20.

* [x] **Ordinal days (`ddd`) reviewed against the committed CLDR spec** — conforms on every normative point, and ships as a technical preview while CLDR's spec is pre-beta. 2026-09-20.

* [x] **Variant currency symbols** — `Localize.Currency.variant_symbol` and `currency_symbol: :variant`, which pick up the new Unicode 18 currency signs at the next data refresh. 2026-09-20.

* [x] **Public functions return errors instead of raising on wrong-type input** — plan item 41, swept across the public API. 2026-09-20.

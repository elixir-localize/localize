# TODO

Outstanding work on Localize. The design detail behind these items lives under [plans/](plans/); the shipped history is in [CHANGELOG.md](CHANGELOG.md), and the release standing is in [STATUS.md](STATUS.md).

## Open

* [ ] **Stop carrying the 554 MB CLDR source payload in the working tree** — 96% of it is JSON that `unicode-org/cldr-json` already publishes as an 80 MB release asset, and `main` tracking it while `cldr-49` ignores it is what makes switching between them error-prone. Analysis in [plans/cldr-source-payload.md](plans/cldr-source-payload.md).

* [ ] **Decide what `dddd` means before 1.4.0 ships** — CLDR 49 gives `ddd` the ordinal day, but `dddd` still renders a zero-padded day ("0006") under the pre-49 numeric rule, and TR35 hints that a future `wide` `dayOfMonth` width may claim it. Settling it after release would be a breaking change.

* [ ] **Decide whether root's `arab` and `arabext` blocks become a pipeline source** — plan item 38: CLDR JSON does not carry them, so `en-u-nu-arab` formats with the locale's `latn` symbols until `common/main/root.xml` is read directly.

* [ ] **Settle the location format of a non-location zone with CLDR** — TR35 49 says a zone with no region (`PST8PDT`, `Etc/GMT+5`) falls back to the offset format, then gives "PST8PDT, generic → Unknown Location Time" as its worked example. Localize follows the first; the conformance data has no case. Worth a CLDR ticket.

## In progress

* [ ] **CLDR 49 upgrade** — the plan's items are closed bar those listed here; what remains is the beta2 refresh below and the `dddd` decision above. Work lives on the `cldr-49` branch, which does not merge to `main` until the final beta. [plans/cldr-49.md](plans/cldr-49.md).

## Blocked

* [ ] **Refresh to CLDR 49 beta2 and re-run the conformance suites** — blocked on the CLDR 49 beta2 release, expected 2026-10. It brings the `scope="core"` display-name fix (CLDR-19774, which missed beta1), `datetime.json` in the Clock12/Clock24 labels, and CLDR-19066's skeleton test data, vendored from CLDR `main` ahead of it.

* [ ] **Interval patterns inherited from a different locale level than the single date** — plan item 35: whether to glue or keep the inherited pattern. Blocked on CLDR-14207.

## Deferred

* [ ] **`localize_emoji` sibling library** — plan item 11, a separate package on its own schedule. A Phoenix LiveView picker (`localize_emoji_live`) is out of scope for its 0.1.0.

## Done

* [x] **Locale downloads retry transient CDN failures** — server errors, timeouts and dropped connections are retried with backoff and jitter, a 404 fails at once, and the address family is configurable. Details in [plans/locale-downloader-resilience.md](plans/locale-downloader-resilience.md). 2026-09-24.

* [x] **Atom creation audited across the library and tests** — no test mints an atom from a fixture file; `Localize.Utils.Json` lost its atom-key option; `Localize.Inflection` rejects a path-shaped locale. The remaining runtime conversions in `lib/` are bounded and say why. 2026-09-24.

* [x] **CLDR's spec changes since beta1 reviewed** — hour cycle variations, the Date-Timezone and Time-Day-Of-Week glue, `placeholderBoundarySpacing`, plural rules in semantic order and `ha` ≡ `h` implemented; range separator patterns confirmed example-only; pattern-only skeleton symbols are only deprecated for CLDR 50. 2026-09-24.

* [x] **CLDR's full skeleton conformance data** — three further CLDR files wired in, and the matching defects they exposed fixed: weekday and year symbols, text widths, `j`/`C` day periods, lone fields, quoted literals, and skeletons matching `availableFormats` alone. 2026-09-24.

* [x] **Supplemental data regenerated from the beta1 sources** — the committed ETFs predated them: the US POSIX zones, the Eurozone, Breton collation and `u` validity changed. 2026-09-24.

* [x] **Refresh to CLDR 49 beta1** — sources from the cldr-json release zip, a guard against mixing pre-releases in `copy_sources`, and a recorded baseline for curated fixtures. 2026-09-24.

* [x] **Report the cldr-json `scope="core"` defect** — fixed upstream as CLDR-19774, which missed beta1; it arrives with beta2. 2026-09-24.

* [x] **Numeric date and time separators** — `Localize.DateTime.numeric_separators/2`, plus `:numeric_date_separator` and `:numeric_time_separator` on `Localize.Date`, `Localize.Time`, `Localize.DateTime` and `Localize.Interval`. 2026-09-20.

* [x] **Ordinal days (`ddd`) reviewed against the committed CLDR spec** — conforms on every normative point, and ships as a technical preview while CLDR's spec is pre-beta. 2026-09-20.

* [x] **Variant currency symbols** — `Localize.Currency.variant_symbol` and `currency_symbol: :variant`, which pick up the new Unicode 18 currency signs at the next data refresh. 2026-09-20.

* [x] **Public functions return errors instead of raising on wrong-type input** — plan item 41, swept across the public API. 2026-09-20.

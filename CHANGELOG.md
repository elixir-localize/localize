## [0.1.0] — April 13th, 2026

Initial release.

### Highlights

* Full CLDR v48.2 locale data with lazy runtime loading from ETF files cached in `:persistent_term`. No compile-time backend configuration required.

* Number formatting — integers, decimals, percentages, currencies, ranges, and rule-based number formats (RBNF) including Roman numerals and CJK ideographs.

* Date, time, and datetime formatting using CLDR calendar patterns with `:short`, `:medium`, `:long`, and `:full` styles, custom skeleton patterns, and interval formatting.

* Unit formatting with plural-aware patterns, SI/binary prefixes, compound units, measurement system conversion, custom unit registration, and `Localize.Unit.Operators` for natural arithmetic (`km + m`).

* List formatting with locale-appropriate conjunctions, disjunctions, and unit list styles. Per-element formatting via `Localize.Chars`.

* ICU MessageFormat 2 (MF2) parser and interpreter with custom function registry, offset selection, JSON interchange, and bidirectional text support.

* Gettext integration — `Localize.Gettext.Interpolation` provides MF2-based interpolation for Gettext backends.

* `Localize.Chars` protocol — polymorphic locale-aware formatting with built-in implementations for 14 types and `Any` fallback to `Kernel.to_string/1`.

* Currency metadata, ISO 4217 validation, custom currency registration (private-use and extended codes), and territory-to-currency mapping.

* Display names for territories, languages, scripts, calendars, and full locale display names per the CLDR algorithm.

* Unicode Collation Algorithm (UCA) with CLDR locale-specific tailoring for 97 languages, including digraph expansion and script reordering.

* BCP 47 / RFC 5646 language tag parser with full Unicode extension support (`-u-`, `-t-`), locale distance matching, and parent chain resolution.

* On-disk locale cache with HTTPS download provider, version-based staleness detection, and `mix localize.download_locales` for build-time cache population.

* Optional NIF backend for faster Unicode normalisation and collation sort-key generation.

* Calendar data for all CLDR calendar systems including Buddhist, Hebrew, Islamic (5 variants), ROC, Indian, Persian, Coptic, Ethiopic, Chinese, Japanese, and Dangi.

* All public API functions return a standardized `{:error, exception}` (except bang variants). The exception is a standard Elixir exception struct populated with semantic information about the error. The error message can be returned by `Exception.message(exception)`. The exception messages are all Gettext messages using the MF2 format and can be localized.

See the [README](README.md) for full documentation, configuration options, and usage examples.
